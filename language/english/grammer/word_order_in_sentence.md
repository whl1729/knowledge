# 英语句子的单词顺序

最近阅读一些英文书籍，发现有些句子的单词顺序跟正常顺序不一样，
先记录下来，有空再总结。

## 《Living Without Appeal: An Affirmative Philosophy of Life》

- But he should select **as his topic** some issue which is of concern to all men,
  or at least most men, at some time in their lives.

> 伍注：原来的顺序应该是 select some issue as his topic.

## 《The Meaning of Live》 (Richard Taylor)

- If, then, we can bring **before our minds** a clear image of meaningless existence,
  then perhaps we can take a step toward coping with our original question by seeing to what extent our lives,
  as we actually find them, resemble that image, and draw such lessons as we are able to from the comparison.

- At this point, then, we can reintroduce what has been until now, it is hoped, resolutely pushed aside in an effort to view our lives and human existence with objectivity;
  namely, our own wills, our deep interest in what we find ourselves doing.

> 伍注：看不懂这句话。

## 《The Absurd》 (Thomas Nagel)

- After acknowledging that their truth is incompatible with possibilities that we have no grounds for believing do not obtain—
  apart from grounds in those very beliefs which we have called into question—
  we return to our familiar convictions with a certain irony and resignation.

> 伍注：看不懂这句话，主要是"believing do not obtain"不知道是怎么跟前面连接的。

## 《Absurd Self-Fulfillment》 (Joel Feinberg)

- But it is logically irrelevant to the question of what my good is whether my good is itself "good" when judged from an external position.
