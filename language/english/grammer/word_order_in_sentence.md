# 英语句子的单词顺序

最近阅读一些英文书籍，发现有些句子的单词顺序跟正常顺序不一样，
先记录下来，有空再总结。

## 《Living Without Appeal: An Affirmative Philosophy of Life》

- But he should select as his topic some issue which is of concern to all men,
  or at least most men, at some time in their lives.

> 伍注：原来的顺序应该是 select some issue as his topic.
