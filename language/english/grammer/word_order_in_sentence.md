# 英语句子的单词顺序

最近阅读一些英文书籍，发现有些句子的单词顺序跟正常顺序不一样，
先记录下来，有空再总结。

## 《Living Without Appeal: An Affirmative Philosophy of Life》

- But he should select **as his topic** some issue which is of concern to all men,
  or at least most men, at some time in their lives.

> 伍注：原来的顺序应该是 select some issue as his topic.

## 《The Meaning of Live》 (Richard Taylor)

- If, then, we can bring **before our minds** a clear image of meaningless existence,
  then perhaps we can take a step toward coping with our original question by seeing to what extent our lives,
  as we actually find them, resemble that image, and draw such lessons as we are able to from the comparison.

- At this point, then, we can reintroduce what has been until now, it is hoped, resolutely pushed aside in an effort to view our lives and human existence with objectivity;
  namely, our own wills, our deep interest in what we find ourselves doing.

> 伍注：暂时看不懂这句话。
