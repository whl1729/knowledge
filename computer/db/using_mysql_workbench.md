## Column flags

以下解释来自[What do column flags mean in MySQL Workbench?][1]。

- PK: Primary Key
- NN: Not Null
- BIN: Binary (stores data as binary strings. There is no character set so sorting and comparison is based on the numeric values of the bytes in the values.)
- UN: Unsigned (non-negative numbers only. so if the range is -500 to 500, instead its 0 - 1000, the range is the same but it starts at 0)
- UQ: Create/remove Unique Key
- ZF: Zero-Filled (if the length is 5 like INT(5) then every field is filled with 0’s to the 5th digit. 12 = 00012, 400 = 00400, etc. )
- AI: Auto Increment
- G: Generated column. i.e. value generated by a formula based on the other columns.
